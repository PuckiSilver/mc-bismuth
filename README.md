# **mc-bismuth**
This projects adds a robust dynamic spell casting system.

Use a catalyst in your offhand to cast a spell from an item in your mainhand.

For this data pack to work, the vanilla ender eye behavior has been disabled, so you can't use them to find the stronghold.

This library shows cool down visually using the [mc-silica](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/mc-silica) resource pack.

## **Prerequisites**
Make sure to use the [mc-silica](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/mc-silica) resource pack for your spells to display the cool down.

Merge this data pack with your data pack or use it as an external data pack.

## **Cool Down Calculation**
mc-bismuth uses `spell haste` and not a percentage cool down reduction. `spell haste` uses the same calculation that `ability haste` in [league of legends](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Haste#Formula) uses and is therefore calculated like this:
```ini
remaining_cool_down = ( cool_down *  100 ) / ( 100 + spell_haste )
```

## **Register a new Spell**
### **Spell Dictionary Function**
First, you need to create a spell dictionary function in your pack that is used detemine the spell, that should be executed.
To create such a function you can look at the `template_spell_dictionary` function in [`main.bolt`](src/data/bismuth/modules/main.bolt).

### **Information Available**
When the spell dictionary is called and is calling your spells, you have access to the following information:

|Type||Description|
|---|---|---|
|Scoreboard|`.id_spell` `bismuth`|The id that you have assigned to your spell|
|Scoreboard|`@s` `bismuth.charge`|The time in ticks that right click has been held for|
|Scoreboard|`.finished` `bismuth`|If this score is 1, right click has been let go, meaning that the "charge" has been completed<br>0 otherwise|
|Context|`@s`|The spell dictionary is executed `as` and `at` the player that used the spell|

To put the executed spell on cooldown, you can set the score `.cooldown` `bismuth` to the cool down in ticks and use the `bismuth:cool_down/set` function to apply it.

### **Register the Spell Dictionary Function**
Create a spell dictionary function and register it to the `bismuth:spell_dictionary` function tag:

`/data/bismuth/tags/functions/spell_dictionary.json`
```json
{
    "values": [
        "<namespace>:<path to your function>"
    ]
}
```

## **Get the Items**
You can use the [`items.bolt`](src/data/bismuth/modules/items.bolt) file as a guide to create loot tables, that give yourself catalyst- and spell items.
If you use `beet` and `bolt` yourself, you can just copy the file and use it in your project.

Alernatively you could use a `give` command like the following ones:
```mcfunction
give @s minecraft:ender_eye{bismuth.catalyst:1b,CustomModelData:123456,magn:{spell_haste:15},AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:"generic.luck",Name:"tungsten.offhand",Amount:-0.000000000001,Operation:0,UUID:[I;12,42069,-0,11],Slot:"offhand"}]}
```
This command gives the player a catalyst, that is an `ender eye` with the `CustomModelData` 123456 and a `spell haste` of 15.

```mcfunction
give @s minecraft:leather_horse_armor{CustomModelData:654321,magn:{spell_id:42069},AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:"generic.luck",Name:"tungsten.mainhand",Amount:-0.000000000001,Operation:0,UUID:[I;12,42069,-0,10],Slot:"mainhand"}]}
```
This command gives the player a catalyst, that is an `ender eye` with the `CustomModelData` 654321 and a `spell id` of 42069.

## **Dependencies**
#### **Resource Pack**
The resource pack used to show the cool down visually. If you are not using this resource pack it will not look correct.
- [mc-silica](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/mc-silica)

#### **Included Libraries**
No need to download these, they are included in the final data pack.
- [mc-magnesium](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/mc-magnesium)
- [mc-tungsten](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/mc-tungsten)

#### **Development Environment**
This project is written using the following but if you just want to use this library, you don't need to download these.
